# TUI Reference

Complete reference for agent-deck Terminal UI features.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `↓` | Move down |
| `k` / `↑` | Move up |
| `h` / `←` | Collapse group / go to parent |
| `l` / `→` / `Tab` | Toggle expand/collapse group |
| `1-9` | Jump to Nth root group |

### Session Actions

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Attach to session OR toggle group |
| `n` | New session (inherits current group) |
| `r` | Rename session or group |
| `R` | Restart session (reloads MCPs) |
| `+` / `K` / `Shift+↑` | Move item up (auto-promotes a sub-session to top-level when at the parent's first child) |
| `-` / `J` / `Shift+↓` | Move item down (auto-promotes a sub-session to top-level when at the parent's last child) |
| `Shift+→` / `Shift+←` | Indent / outdent within current group (single-level nesting) |
| `M` | Move session to different group |
| `m` | Open MCP Manager (Claude/Gemini) |
| `s` | Open Skills Manager |
| `d` | Delete session or group |
| `A` | Archive session (stops tmux, hides from default list; conversations/metadata untouched) |
| `Shift+U` | Unarchive session (restores to list; does NOT auto-start tmux) |
| `b` | Re-run worktree setup script (`.agent-deck/worktree-setup.sh`) |
| `u` | Mark unread (idle -> waiting); on a remote host header showing `v<old> ↑`, update that remote after confirmation |
| `f` | Quick fork (Claude/OpenCode/Pi/Codex) |
| `F` | Fork with options (Claude/OpenCode/Pi/Codex) |

For remote group headers, `Enter`/`Tab` toggles collapse and `h`/Left collapses or moves to the parent. A remote host header shows `v1.15.0 ↑` after its count when the remote runs an older agent-deck than this controller (the version is asked once per hour per remote on the session poll); `u` on that header opens "Update remote <name> from v<old> to v<new>?" and runs the same verified deploy as `agent-deck remote update <name>`. Remote-session reorder keys move only within the current remote group; the order is saved on the viewing machine, while remote group headers remain name-sorted.

### Group Actions

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `g` | Create group (subgroup if on group) |
| `r` | Rename group |

### Search & Filter

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `/` | Local search (fuzzy) |
| `G` | Global search (all Claude conversations) |
| `Tab` | Switch between local/global search |
| `0` | Clear filter (show all) |
| `!` | Filter: running only (toggle) |
| `@` | Filter: waiting only (toggle) |
| `#` | Filter: idle only (toggle) |
| `&` | Filter: error only (toggle) |
| `^` | Filter: view archived sessions (toggle) |

### Global

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `?` | Help overlay |
| `i` | Import existing tmux sessions |
| `Ctrl+R` | Manual refresh |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Detach (keep tmux running) |
| `$` | Cost Dashboard |
| `Ctrl+Y` | Install the available update now (`install_update`; runs `agent-deck update` on the terminal, see [Updates](#updates)) |
| `Ctrl+T` | Restart agent-deck in place now (`restart_deck`; the new build starts with the same args, env and selection) |
| `q` / `Ctrl+C` | Quit |

## Local Status Indicators

| Symbol | Status | Color | Meaning |
|--------|--------|-------|---------|
| `●` | Running | Green | Active, content changed in last 2s |
| `◐` | Waiting | Yellow | Stopped, unacknowledged |
| `○` | Idle | Gray | Stopped, acknowledged |
| `✕` | Error | Red | tmux session doesn't exist |
| `⟳` | Starting | Yellow | Session launching |

Federated remote rows currently carry coarse running/waiting/idle/error status; local Honest Status substates are not included in the remote payload.

## Dialogs

### New Session (`n`)

**Fields (order: Name → Tool → Model → Reasoning effort → Path):**
- Session name (required)
- Command (claude/gemini/opencode/codex/custom) — the dialog remembers the last-used tool (persisted per profile, never written to config.toml; an explicit `default_tool` in config wins)
- Model ID (claude/codex/gemini/opencode): empty means the tool default; `↓` or `Space` opens the list of known IDs, or type any ID (CLI: `--model`)
- Reasoning effort (claude/codex): `←`/`→` or `Space` cycles the levels (CLI: `--effort`)
- Project path (required, supports `~/`)
- Parent group (auto-selected)
- Claude options (when Claude is selected): permission mode, Chrome, teammate mode, extra args, start query, and the account row (CLI: `--account`; hidden when no named accounts are configured)
- `[ Create session ]` button (last row)

**Controls:** `Enter` next field on every row (inside the Claude options it steps row by row) | `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` and `↓`/`↑` move fields the same way | `Enter` on `[ Create session ]` or `Ctrl+S` anywhere creates | `Esc` back out of a list, then cancel

Enter-advances is the default (`[ui].new_session_enter_advances = true`): Enter never creates the session until you reach the Create button, so typing a name and pressing Enter through the form no longer launches a session before you have chosen the model, path, or options. The footer on every row says what Enter does there. Set `[ui].new_session_enter_advances = false` to restore the legacy behavior where Enter creates from any row; `Ctrl+S` creates in both modes.

Pressing `n` on a remote group/session opens a remote-aware dialog (remote paths and group pre-filled); the session is created over SSH on the remote, never on localhost.

Claude New Session defaults are remembered in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agent-deck/config.toml` (default `~/.config/agent-deck/config.toml`) under `[claude]`, except start query and resume IDs, which are per-launch values.

### Edit Session (`Shift+P`)

Edits the fields a session iterates on at runtime: Title, Harness (tool), Pin position, the account row (shown when `[profiles.<name>.*].config_dir` slots are configured for a supported harness), and for claude sessions Skip permissions, Auto mode, Extra args, Plugins.

**Controls:** `Tab`/`↓` `Shift+Tab`/`↑` move rows | `←`/`→` choose (pills) | `Space` toggle (checkboxes) | `Enter` save | `Esc` cancel. The footer says what the keys do on the focused row; on a changed harness or account row it reads "Enter switch (asks first)".

A harness or account change is saved on its own (not together with other edits) and always asks first: a same-harness account change shows "Switch Account?" (from → to, what happens), a different harness shows the transfer disclosure. `y`/Switch runs it, `n`/Esc returns to the row with nothing written; the outcome is reported in a notice. CLI equivalents: `agent-deck session switch-account <session> <account>` (same flow), `agent-deck session set <session> account <name>`, `agent-deck session switch <session> --to-harness <tool> [--to-account <account>]` (preview with `session switch-preview`); `agent-deck accounts` lists the slots.

### MCP Manager (`m`)

**Layout:**
- Two columns: Attached | Available
- Two scopes: LOCAL | GLOBAL

**Controls:**
- `Tab` - Switch scope
- `←/→` - Switch columns
- `↑/↓` - Navigate
- `Type letters/digits` - Jump to MCP name prefix
- `Space` - Toggle MCP
- `Enter` - Apply changes
- `Esc` - Cancel

**Indicators:**
- `(l)` LOCAL scope
- `(g)` GLOBAL scope
- `(p)` PROJECT scope
- `🔌` MCP is pooled
- `⟳` Pending restart

### Skills Manager (`s`)

**Layout:**
- Two columns: Attached | Available
- Available is pool-only (`source=pool`)
- Column headers include counts (for example: `Attached (3)`, `Available (28)`)

**Controls:**
- `←/→` - Switch columns
- `↑/↓` - Navigate (scrolls long lists)
- `Type letters/digits` - Jump to skill name prefix
- `Space` - Move skill between columns
- `Enter` - Apply changes
- `Esc` - Cancel

**Persistence:**
- Writes attachment state to `<project>/.agent-deck/skills.toml`
- Claude-compatible sessions materialize selected entries in `<project>/.claude/skills`
- Gemini, Codex, and Pi sessions materialize selected entries in `<project>/.agents/skills`
- If no pool entries exist, dialog shows guidance for `~/.agent-deck/skills/pool`

**Runtime notes:**
- Skills Manager is available for Claude, Gemini, Codex, and Pi sessions
- Pressing `Enter` reconciles managed attachments to the active runtime root even if the attached list did not change
- Auto-restart after apply is supported for Claude, Gemini, and Codex; Pi requires manual reload/restart

### Fork Dialog (`F`)

**Fields:**
- Session title (pre-filled)
- Group (auto-selected)

**Controls:** `Enter` fork | `Esc` cancel

### Delete Confirmation (`d`)

**For sessions:** Warning about tmux kill, process termination

**For groups:** Sessions move to default (not deleted)

**Controls:** `y` confirm | `n`/`Esc` cancel

## Search

### Local Search (`/`)

- Fuzzy search session titles and groups
- Max 10 results
- `↑/↓` or `Ctrl+K/J` navigate
- `Enter` select | `Tab` switch to global | `Esc` close

### Global Search (`G`)

- Full content search across `~/.claude/projects/`
- Regex + fuzzy matching
- Recency ranking
- Split view: results + preview
- `[/]` scroll preview
- `Enter` create/jump to session

**Config:**
```toml
[global_search]
enabled = true
recent_days = 30
```

## Preview Pane

## Updates

The TUI checks for a new release on startup and every 5 minutes, and watches its own binary on disk once per tick (one `stat`; a `version` probe only when the file changed). What happens next depends on `[updates]` in config.toml (both default to `true`, both also in the Settings panel under UPDATES):

| Setting | On (default) | Off |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| `auto_install` | When a release is installable the TUI runs `agent-deck update --unattended --trigger tui` in the background (no prompt, the deck stays usable). One attempt per version per hour; a failure shows one footer line ("auto-update to vX failed: ...; run agent-deck update"). Skipped for Homebrew-managed installs, while a release is still publishing, and under `AGENTDECK_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK`. | Banner: `⬆ Update available: vA → vB (... press ctrl+y to install (agent-deck update) · Esc to dismiss)` for 6+ releases behind; `Ctrl+Y` installs interactively. |
| `auto_restart` | Once a newer build is on disk the banner reads `⬆ vX installed, restarting when idle (ctrl+t now)` and the TUI restarts itself at the first tick with no dialog open, no insert mode and no session action in flight (attached sessions are never interrupted: the restart only happens from the home screen). After the restart the footer says `restarted into vNEW (was vOLD)` and the cursor is back on the session it was on. | Banner: `⬆ vX installed, press ctrl+t to restart agent-deck`; `Ctrl+T` restarts when you choose. |

Before the restart is armed (by the key or on its own) the TUI checks the file it is about to exec: it must be a regular, non-empty, executable file that answers `agent-deck version`; otherwise the restart is refused with a footer message (`restart blocked: new binary ... ; still running vOLD`) and the old build keeps running. The restart replaces the process in place (same executable path, args and environment), so tmux sessions, MCP pools and the web server are untouched. `web --no-tui` restarts itself the same way when no request is in flight; a remote agent exits cleanly instead and the controller reconnects. None of this happens on its own when the TUI is driven by a test, CI or a script: under `go test`, with `AGENTDECK_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK` set, with `CI` truthy, with an `AGENTDECK_TEST_*` marker, or without a terminal on stdin and stdout, the banner reverts to `press ctrl+t to restart agent-deck` and only the keys act (issue #2251).
