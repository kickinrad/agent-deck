# Troubleshooting Guide

Common issues and solutions for agent-deck.

## Quick Fixes

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Session shows `✕` error | `agent-deck session start <name>` |
| MCPs not loading | `agent-deck session restart <name>` |
| CLI changes not in TUI | Press `Ctrl+R` to refresh |
| Flag not working | Put flags BEFORE arguments |
| Fork fails | Check Claude session has a valid session ID, or Pi session has JSONL history under Agent Deck's Pi session dir |
| Status stuck | Wait 2 seconds or press `u` to mark unread |

## Common Issues

### Cannot Select or Copy Terminal Text

On the agent-deck home screen, select a local session and press `V` to copy its
current visible terminal text, including links, as plain text.

When attached to a session, tmux mouse mode owns normal drag gestures. Hold
Option while dragging in iTerm2. Hold Shift while dragging in most Linux
terminals and Windows Terminal, including WSL2. This bypasses application mouse
reporting and lets the terminal perform native selection.

The full explanation of why mouse capture blocks selection, plus the complete
copy-key table (`c` / `C` / `V` / `Y`), lives in
[Terminal shortcuts](../../../docs/terminal-shortcuts.md#text-selection-and-copying)
and the [TUI Reference](tui-reference.md#copy--text-selection).

If your terminal has no selection bypass, disable mouse mode for new and
reconnected sessions:

```toml
[tmux]
mouse = false
```

This restores native drag selection, but disables tmux mouse scrolling, pane
resizing, and mouse copy mode.

### Flags Ignored

**Problem:** Flags after positional arguments are silently ignored.

```bash
# WRONG - message not sent
agent-deck session start my-project -m "Hello"

# CORRECT
agent-deck session start -m "Hello" my-project
```

### MCP Not Available

1. Check if attached: `agent-deck mcp attached <session>`
2. Restart session: `agent-deck session restart <session>`
3. Verify in config: `agent-deck mcp list`

### Session ID Not Detected

Claude session ID needed for fork/resume. Check:

```bash
agent-deck session show <name> --json | jq '.claude_session_id'
```

If null, restart session and interact with Claude.

### Conductor Keeps Asking for Permissions

If a conductor repeatedly pauses on permission prompts, set Claude permission mode
explicitly in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agent-deck/config.toml` (default `~/.config/agent-deck/config.toml`) and restart the conductor session:

```toml
[claude]
# Safer default for automation-heavy conductors:
allow_dangerous_mode = true

# Or fully non-interactive (least safe):
# dangerous_mode = true
```

Then restart the conductor:

```bash
agent-deck session restart conductor-<name>
```

If you use multiple profiles, set the same under the profile override:

```toml
[profiles.work.claude]
allow_dangerous_mode = true
```

### Atuin Pty-Proxy Incompatibility

**Problem:** TUI shows a blank screen or fails to render when `eval "$(atuin pty-proxy init zsh)"` is in `.zshrc`.

**Cause:** Atuin pty-proxy acts as a PTY MITM between the terminal and the shell. Agent Deck's Bubble Tea TUI requires direct terminal access for alternate screen mode, mouse tracking, and raw-mode I/O. These all break when stdin/stdout are proxied pipes.

**Fix:** Replace the pty-proxy init line with standard atuin init:

```bash
# REMOVE this line:
eval "$(atuin pty-proxy init zsh)"

# REPLACE with this:
eval "$(atuin init zsh)"
```

For bash:
```bash
eval "$(atuin init bash)"
```

For fish:
```fish
atuin init fish | source
```

Atuin pty-proxy is only needed for the atuin TUI overlay feature and is not required for normal shell history functionality. Agent Deck works fine with standard `atuin init`.

### High CPU Usage

**With many sessions:** Normal if batched updates. Check:
```bash
agent-deck status  # Should show ~0.5% CPU when idle
```

**With active session:** Normal (live preview updates).

### Log Files Too Large

Add to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agent-deck/config.toml` (default `~/.config/agent-deck/config.toml`):
```toml
[logs]
max_size_mb = 1
max_lines = 2000
```

### Global Search Not Working

Check config:
```toml
[global_search]
enabled = true
```

Also verify `~/.claude/projects/` exists and has content.

### Shift+Enter Submits Instead of Inserting a Newline (Kitty)

In **kitty**, Shift+Enter (and other modified keys) may submit immediately
inside agent-deck even though they insert a newline when the agent runs
natively. This is a kitty-specific quirk: tmux negotiates extended keys with
the outer terminal using xterm's *modifyOtherKeys* protocol, which kitty does
not implement (kitty only speaks its own CSI-u keyboard protocol). So kitty
keeps sending a bare carriage return and the agent submits.

agent-deck already sets `extended-keys-format csi-u` on its tmux sessions so
that, *once the terminal sends a distinct Shift+Enter*, it reaches the agent in
the form Claude Code understands. The remaining piece must be set in kitty
itself — make kitty emit the CSI-u Shift+Enter unconditionally:

```conf
# ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf
map shift+enter send_text all \x1b[13;2u
```

Reload kitty's config (`Ctrl+Shift+F5`) and Shift+Enter will insert a newline,
both natively and inside agent-deck. iTerm2, Ghostty, WezTerm and xterm honor
modifyOtherKeys and do not need this mapping.

### Progressive Display Corruption Inside tmux (duplicated rows, mojibake, junk after scroll)

Symptoms: rows duplicated or shifted down, stray escape characters, leftover
junk after a scroll or resize. It builds up over days, affects every session on
the machine, reproduces under any agent, and does **not** reproduce in a bare
terminal without tmux.

Check the tmux server's `terminal-features` array:

```bash
tmux show-options -s terminal-features | wc -l          # default socket
tmux -L <socket_name> show-options -s terminal-features | wc -l   # if [tmux].socket_name is set
```

A healthy server reports a handful of lines. Thousands mean the array is
inflated (issue #2061): agent-deck versions up to v1.15.0 appended
`*:hyperlinks:extkeys` to that **server-wide** option on every session
configuration pass, with no membership check. `*` matches every terminal and
tmux walks the array on every capability lookup, so the duplicates turn into
display corruption. Reported counts reached 5,018 entries (219.8 KB) after weeks
of uptime.

Two things matter about where the damage lives:

- It is in the **tmux server**, not in the agent-deck binary. That is why
  downgrading or upgrading agent-deck changes nothing while the server keeps
  running, and why nobody notices the cause — restarting the tmux server would
  destroy every live agent session.
- The fix for #2061 reads exact indexed entries, installs through a shared
  no-overwrite slot and removes duplicates with guarded indexed deletions.
  Another client's appended or changed entries are preserved. Cleanup is
  conservative: comma-bearing or blank values leave existing duplicates alone,
  and concurrent changes or a timeout may leave work for a later pass. See the
  [configuration reference](config-reference.md) for the shared slot
  `terminal-features[2147483647]`. A foreign or empty occupant is preserved;
  `terminal_features_installation_deferred` reports observed absence after an
  installation attempt. Free that slot or set an explicit override to install
  the feature, and do not interpret a quiet no-overwrite exit as proof of presence. The new binary must be the one running sessions;
  while an old binary is still driving them, the array keeps growing.

To reset the array immediately, without restarting the server:

```bash
tmux set -su terminal-features      # back to tmux's built-in defaults
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf       # re-apply your own terminal-features lines, if any
```

Add `-L <socket_name>` to both commands when `[tmux].socket_name` is set. The
first command is safe on a live server: it resets one option and touches no
session, window or pane. If you prefer to pin the value yourself and have
agent-deck never write it, set it in config.toml — an explicit key opts out of
agent-deck's default entirely:

```toml
[tmux.options]
terminal-features = "*:hyperlinks:extkeys"
```

### One tmux Window Stuck at 80x24 While Its Siblings Are Full Width

`window-size` and `aggressive-resize` are tmux **window** options. Agent Deck
applies `window-size latest` (`largest` on a tmux older than 3.1, which has no
`latest`) and `aggressive-resize on` to every window of a Deck session: the
initial window at session start, windows created by **Open Shell Here** in
window mode, windows opened any other way inside the session (`prefix c`, an
agent's own `tmux new-window`, a control client; since v1.16.11), and, again,
every existing window right before each attach (TUI Enter, `session attach` on
a remote, the web and embedded clients), because `resize-window` pins a window
to `manual` and a session created by an older build keeps the `smallest` it
was given. Explicit `[tmux.options]` values replace those defaults on every
path. For a new shell window, a local option installed by your
`after-new-window` hook takes precedence.

With two people on one session under `latest`, the window follows whoever
attached, typed or resized last: the person using the session sees it
full-size, and the idle terminal shows the other person's size (clipped if it
is smaller, the pane in the top-left corner with dots around it if it is
larger) until they type or resize. That is tmux's one-size-per-window rule,
not a stuck window. The deck's `👁️ N` row badge and `session viewers` say who
else has the session open.

Windows opened by hand get the policy from one `after-new-window` hook that
Deck keeps in a reserved slot (`after-new-window[2259]`) of the server's
global hook array. Your own global `after-new-window` hook keeps running in
Deck sessions, and a `window-size` or `aggressive-resize` value it installs
takes precedence over Deck's (Deck applies its values with `set-option -o`).
Sessions Deck did not start are not touched. `tmux show-hooks -g` shows both
entries; `set-hook -g after-new-window ...` without `-a` replaces the whole
array, including Deck's slot, until the next Deck session starts.

What persists, and how to remove it. The hook lives on the tmux **server**
(the default one, or `[tmux].socket_name`), so it outlives every Deck
process and stays after Deck is uninstalled, until the server restarts or
you remove it. It is inert on its own: with no `@agentdeck_*` option on the
session every `if-shell -F` test is false and nothing is written. The
`@agentdeck_window_size` / `@agentdeck_aggressive_resize` options are
per-session and disappear with the session. To inspect or remove the hook:

```bash
agent-deck tmux-hooks status      # absent, agent-deck's, or foreign
agent-deck tmux-hooks uninstall   # removes after-new-window[2259] only if it is agent-deck's
tmux set-hook -gu 'after-new-window[2259]'   # the same by hand (add -L <socket_name> if set)
```

Run the uninstall before `agent-deck uninstall` if you want the server clean;
the next Deck session start reinstalls it. If something else already occupies
index 2259, Deck leaves it alone, logs `window_policy_hook_slot_foreign`, and
hand-opened windows keep tmux's own defaults until the slot is free. Hooks are
array options from tmux 3.0; on an older server Deck logs
`window_policy_hook_skipped` and only the initial window and Deck-opened
windows get the policy. A `[tmux.options]` value tmux would reject (say
`window-size = "biggest"`) is logged as `window_policy_override_invalid` and
never published to the hook, so it cannot make `new-window` fail; the
generic override pass reports it as before.

Note that the hook only reaches windows created after the session started on
the new binary; a session created before v1.16.11 keeps whatever its windows
had until the next attach re-applies the policy to all of them. If a window is
still stuck, fix it in place with `tmux set-option -w -t <session>:<window>
window-size latest`, or restart the session.

A size policy difference does not by itself establish that a size-less control
client caused a collapse to 80x24; capture window dimensions and client flags
when diagnosing that symptom.

To choose a different policy for all windows, including native tmux windows,
set it in config.toml:

```toml
[tmux.options]
window-size = "smallest"
```

or set your own global default in `~/.tmux.conf` (`set -wg window-size
smallest`) for sessions Deck does not manage.

## Recovery

### Every Session Died At Once

Symptom: the whole deck flips to red (or the panes are simply gone) after a tmux
server was killed, the host rebooted, or an auth failure cascaded through the
fleet.

```bash
agent-deck fleet status          # read-only: what is actually down?
agent-deck fleet recover         # dry run: the plan, in order, with waits
agent-deck fleet recover --yes   # run it
```

For a protected identity, select its full ID explicitly:

```bash
agent-deck fleet recover --yes --session-id <full-id>
```

Groups organize the sidebar and do not select recovery members.

`fleet recover` restarts the down sessions **one at a time** with ~5s between
boots and verifies each boot before starting the next. Do not replace it with a
loop that restarts everything at once: simultaneous agent boots are what fork a
shared rotating OAuth refresh token, which turns a recoverable outage into a
fleet-wide 401.

The sweep stops on its own if three restarts fail in a row, or if sessions come
up showing an auth-failure banner (re-authenticate first, then re-run). Sessions
you stopped or archived are never touched.

If the panes are still ALIVE and only agent-deck thinks they are broken (a
killed control pipe, e.g. after an SSH logout), the cheaper fix is:

```bash
agent-deck session revive --all
```

### Session Metadata Lost

Data stored in SQLite:
```bash
~/.agent-deck/profiles/default/state.db
```

Note: new installs store profiles under `$XDG_DATA_HOME/agent-deck/profiles/` (default `~/.local/share/agent-deck/profiles/`); a legacy `~/.agent-deck/` directory is still honored when present.

Recovery (if state.db is corrupted):
```bash
# If sessions.json.migrated still exists, delete state.db and restart.
# agent-deck will auto-migrate from the .migrated file.
rm ~/.agent-deck/profiles/default/state.db
mv ~/.agent-deck/profiles/default/sessions.json.migrated \
   ~/.agent-deck/profiles/default/sessions.json
# Restart agent-deck to trigger auto-migration into a fresh state.db
```

### tmux Sessions Lost

Session logs preserved:
```bash
tail -500 ~/.agent-deck/logs/agentdeck_<session>_*.log
```

### Profile Corrupted

Create fresh:
```bash
agent-deck profile create fresh
agent-deck profile default fresh
```

## Uninstalling

Remove agent-deck from your system:

```bash
agent-deck uninstall              # Interactive uninstall
agent-deck uninstall --dry-run    # Preview what would be removed
agent-deck uninstall --keep-data  # Remove binary only, keep sessions
```

Or use the standalone script:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asheshgoplani/agent-deck/main/uninstall.sh | bash
```

**What gets removed:**
- **Binary:** `~/.local/bin/agent-deck` or `/usr/local/bin/agent-deck`
- **Homebrew:** `agent-deck` package (if installed via brew)
- **tmux config:** The `# agent-deck configuration` block in `~/.tmux.conf`
- **Data directory:** `~/.agent-deck/` (sessions, logs, config)

Use `--keep-data` to preserve your sessions and configuration.

## Critical Warnings

**NEVER run these commands - they destroy ALL agent-deck sessions:**

```bash
# DO NOT RUN
tmux kill-server
tmux ls | grep agentdeck | xargs tmux kill-session
```

**Recovery impossible** - metadata backups exist but tmux sessions are gone.
