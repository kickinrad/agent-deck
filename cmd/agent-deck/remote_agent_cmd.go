// `agent-deck remote-agent` is the remote end of a persistent channel
// (#2174). A local TUI opens ONE ssh session per remote to it and keeps it
// open: requests arrive as JSON lines on stdin ({"id":1,"args":["list",
// "--json"]}), answers leave as JSON lines on stdout ({"id":1,"stdout":"...",
// "stderr":"...","code":0}). Between answers the agent pushes
// {"event":"changed"} whenever the profile's state.db changes, so the TUI
// refetches at once instead of at its next poll.
//
// Each request runs this same binary as a subprocess with the given args, so
// the answer is byte-for-byte what `ssh host agent-deck <args>` would print;
// only the ssh handshake and channel setup per command are gone, and the
// change feed is new. Requests run concurrently; answers carry their id.
// At most remoteAgentMaxConcurrent subprocesses run at once (the rest wait
// their turn), identical read-only requests that overlap share one run and
// each get the answer under their own id, and {"id":N,"cancel":true} kills
// the subprocess of request N (no answer follows for a cancelled request).
//
// The change feed's probe does not fork: it keeps the profile's storage open
// in this process and builds the two listings through the same functions
// `list --json` and `group list --json` print through (buildListJSON,
// buildGroupListJSON). Booting the binary twice per change, each opening
// storage and refreshing every status, was most of the second between a
// change on the remote and the local screen; the event carries the probe's
// duration as probe_ms so that cost stays visible. The probe is read-only:
// this process never registers a global state DB, so the last-activity
// flush a status refresh would otherwise do is a no-op here, and a probe
// never moves the stamp it watches. Stamp changes are debounced: a probe
// runs no sooner than remoteAgentProbeQuiet after the previous one ended,
// and a change landing while a probe runs is probed again instead of being
// taken as seen (safe only because the probe is read-only: nothing it does
// can move the stamp and chain probes).
//
// The listings travel compacted (json.Marshal form, no indentation): the
// same JSON documents `list --json` and `group list --json` print, minus
// whitespace, so the local parser sees the same shape. A "changed" event
// whose listings would exceed remoteAgentMaxPushBytes, whose probe failed,
// or whose listings do not look like a JSON array and object, is pushed
// bare (no listings) so the local side fetches instead of applying junk.
// Each "changed" event and each command reply carries "stamp": the state
// DB's newest mtime (remote clock, unix nanoseconds) when the listing was
// taken, or after the command finished. A pushed listing whose stamp is
// older than the stamp of a mutating command's reply predates that command.
//
// Liveness: the agent pushes {"event":"ping"} every remoteAgentPingEvery
// and exits when a write to stdout fails, when its outbound queue stays
// full for remoteAgentWriteStall (the peer stopped reading), or when
// nothing arrives on stdin for
// remoteAgentIdleAfter. Any line counts as inbound: a request, a cancel or
// {"id":N,"ping":true} (answered with {"id":N,"code":0}; without an id it
// is silently absorbed). Writes go through a bounded queue drained by one
// goroutine, so a dead pipe can hold the watcher or a reply for at most
// that stall, never for good; a slow live pipe merely backpressures them.
//
// Pane watch (#2177 follow-up): {"id":2,"watch":"<sessionID>","lines":200}
// asks the agent to follow one session's tmux pane. The agent captures it
// in-process every ~300ms, keeps the last "lines" lines (all of them when
// the field is absent) and pushes {"event":"pane","session":"<id>",
// "stdout":<text>} whenever that text differs from the last push (the
// first capture is always pushed); a capture failure is pushed once as
// {"event":"pane","session":"<id>","error":"..."}. Only one session is
// watched at a time: a new watch replaces the previous one (a watch for the
// session already watched restarts it, so the current screen is pushed
// again), {"id":3,"unwatch":true} stops it, and closing stdin stops it.
// Both are acknowledged with {"id":N,"code":0}.
// The local TUI uses this for the preview pane of the focused remote row
// instead of polling `session output --pane` over ssh.
