// Issue #1979: the Ctrl+C-then-resend recovery exists for a message lost during
// TUI init, where nothing ever reached the pane. It fired on a different case
// too — a target that is busy and has the message queued, whose working state
// simply is not being observed — and there it interrupted the in-flight turn
// and delivered the body a second time, at exit 0.
//
// #479 established that this path double-sends and disabled it for --no-wait
// (noWaitSendOptions sets maxFullResends: -1). The verified path kept it.
//
// The distinguishing signal is already in the loop: the body appearing in the
// pane is arrival evidence. Once arrival is observed, a resend cannot be a
// recovery — it can only duplicate.

// busyPaneWithBody is what a queued-but-unobserved target looks like: the body
// is present above the composer rules, and the status never reads active.
