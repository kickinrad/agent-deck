// VerifySpawned confirms that the tmux session actually exists after a
// Start()/Restart() returned nil (#2099). The check is authoritative: it asks
// the tmux server on the session's own socket for this exact session name
// (tmux.Session.ProbeExists), never the liveness cache or a timed-out probe's
// "assume alive" answer, and otherwise reads the spawn-failure record. A live
// session returns nil at once. When the session is missing it keeps looking,
// for at most maxWait, for either the session to appear or a spawn-failure
// record to be written (the fast-death watcher records a death on its next
// 250ms tick), and then returns a *SpawnFailedError carrying whatever was
// recorded. A probe that stays indeterminate (server busy, protocol
// mismatch) for the whole window is reported as its own error rather than
// as either verdict.
//
// This is the read-back the CLI was missing: Start() can return nil while
// the pane is already gone (the initial process died before the first
// watcher tick, or an in-flight sibling spawn short-circuited the call), and
// the success message was printed unconditionally.
//
// A tool documented to answer once and exit (expectsFastExit) is exempt, as
// it is from the fast-death watcher: a short life is its success.
