// Hook lag (status-light audit 2026-09-17, defect B; review rounds 2 and 3).
//
// Claude's lifecycle hooks are the primary truth for a Claude session's light,
// and a "running" hook within its freshness window (hookFastPathWindow)
// short-circuits pane inspection. The audit caught the conductor's hook file
// still saying "running" (UserPromptSubmit) while the pane showed "✻ Sautéed
// for 3m 4s · done 9:08 PM" at an empty prompt, and a Stop for that file only
// minutes later. WHY the Stop was late is not established. An earlier draft
// of this note blamed turns that end by calling ScheduleWakeup (counting
// stop_hook_summary transcript records suggested Claude Code fires no Stop
// hook for them); that is wrong — the conductor's own hook file reads
// {"status":"waiting","event":"Stop",…} stamped in the same second such a
// turn ends, so the transcript count measured the wrong thing. The cause is
// unknown; the per-instance hook event history the hook-handler now keeps
// (~/.agent-deck/hooks/<id>.events.jsonl, see cmd/agent-deck/hook_events.go)
// is what would let it be found from the next occurrence.
//
// So the rule below is a disclosed TIE-BREAK for one observable situation —
// the hook says running while the pane shows a finished turn, twice — not a
// fix for a known defect. Its evidence is never a pane capture of its own
// (review P2-5): the completed-turn verdict is recorded by the reads
// GetStatus and GetSubstate already make
// (tmux.Session.recordCompletedTurnSampleLocked), and the running fast path
// only consults that cached sample. Two independent samples of a completed
// turn at an idle prompt (no spinner, no interrupt hint, no open menu, no
// background work — tmux.PromptDetector.CompletedTurnAtIdlePrompt), at least
// CompletedTurnSampleInterval apart and both taken after the hook event,
// flip the light to waiting; the substate says hook-lag from the first sample
// so the disagreement is visible before the light moves. Any busy sample
// clears the evidence, so a live spinner is never contradicted, and a new
// hook event starts over. The pass's own live evidence always wins over the
// persisted record (review round 3 P2-3): a status pass that set waiting from
// the record alone is reverted to running by a busy capture in the same pass
// (absorbCompletedTurnSample), so no single CLI pass prints waiting beside a
// running substate.
//
// The evidence is persisted on the instance record (tool_data.hook_lag,
// review P2-4) so that one-pass CLI callers accumulate samples across
// invocations, the transition daemon (which re-hydrates instances every
// poll) sees the same record, and the TUI picks it up from the status rows it
// already reads each sweep. The surfaces that take a sample are the ones
// that call Instance.Substate — `list --json`, `session children --json` /
// `--follow` (review round 3 P2-4), `status --json --verbose`, `status
// --stale`, `session show --json`, `fleet verify` — and the TUI/daemon pane
// path; every surface reaches the same verdict from the same two samples,
// whichever process captured them. Hook handlers never capture: the
// children summary the parent's UserPromptSubmit/SessionStart hook injects
// (cmd/agent-deck/hook_children_context.go) reads each child's status from
// the hook file and the cached/persisted evidence only (review round 4 P2).
