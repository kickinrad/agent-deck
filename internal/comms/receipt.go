// Consumer contract (docs/comms.md "Consumers, receipts and retention").
//
// Four rules folded in from the MonoCode relay comparison
// (docs/monocode-comms-20261003.md in the conductor's repo):
//
//  1. Every send carries a caller request id (Record.Req) and its receipt
//     is the `send` record itself, committed (durable) BEFORE the action is
//     taken; a retry with the same id gets ErrDuplicate with the stored
//     record and never causes a second delivery (Ledger.Commit, SendKey).
//     In the ledger now (G3/G6); `session send` writes it in P2.
//  2. Reads of a session are bounded: at most N recent records, a per
//     message byte cap (CapText), a cursor for older ones (ReadAfter with a
//     limit, Exported.Cursor), tool noise never stored (records carry the
//     final text only). ReadAfter is here; `msg read --last N` is P2.
//  3. Delivery to an idle parent is one combined wake carrying every pending
//     record (Digest); each record's attempt moves to `attempted` and, if
//     the parent's turn fails, back to pending by a `failed` receipt and a
//     Retry; automatic wakes per parent are capped (MaxAutoWakes) and a
//     parent past the cap waits for a human or its own next turn. P2.
//  4. Where agent-deck launches the harness itself, a producer may read the
//     harness's own protocol stream (Claude stream-json, Codex app-server,
//     ACP, pi rpc, OpenCode SSE) instead of hooks; it spools the same
//     CommsSpoolEntry edges, so the ledger does not care which. P3 or later,
//     per harness, with the same fixture rule as any producer.
// Frozen in P0 so the P2 consumers, the P3 transport and a later workflow
// runner build on one shape: a receipt per (message, recipient, consumer
// generation, attempt) with evidence states that only move forward, and a
// per-consumer acknowledgement state that is a contiguous watermark plus
// sparse acknowledgements, never a scalar cursor that can skip pending
// records when an urgent one overtakes them.

// Receipt evidence states, weakest first. A consumer may report any state
// it can observe; it never reports a stronger one than it has evidence for.
