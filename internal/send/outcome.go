//     this tool offers no submission signal, or the signal did not arrive in
//     the window. Exit 0, and the caller says so out loud. It is never "NOT

//     body is still sitting in the composer after Enter with no turn started,
//     or an interactive menu swallowed the keystrokes. Exit 1 with the
//     evidence line.
